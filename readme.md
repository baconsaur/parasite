#Parasite

Another of my depressing games about depressing shit? Probably.

I decided to do an airplane game jam while visiting my mom. I made most of the prototype during a flight with basically no planning and no internet access, so I have no idea how it's going to turn out. If nothing else, it could be a great example of how NOT to design a game!
